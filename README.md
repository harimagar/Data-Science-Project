# 🛒 Personalized Recommendation System for E-Commerce using Machine Learning

Hi! I'm Hari Gharti Magar, an MSc Data Science with Advanced Research student at the University of Hertfordshire, UK. This project was developed as part of my final dissertation, focusing on "Building and Optimizing a Personalized Recommendation System for E-Commerce Using Machine Learning".

## 📘 Project Summary

This project implements three recommendation system models to suggest products to users:

- **Collaborative Filtering** using SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)
- **Content-Based Filtering** using TF-IDF and Nearest Neighbors
- **Hybrid Model** combining both approaches

Additionally, I built a functional e-commerce website prototype to simulate real-time user interaction and generate purchase data for model training.
